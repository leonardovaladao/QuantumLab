# QuantumLab
 Data analysis for experimental evidences of quantum characteristics of matter. Course made at USP in 2020.
 
## What you wil find in this repository
**Note: Since the course was taken in Brazil, all notebooks were written in portuguese.** <br>
This repository was made during a laboratory course about quantum effects on matter and radiation. In the notebooks, you will find analysis of some experiments evolving quantum physics and some results derived from the analysis. Check them bellow: <br>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/leonardovaladao/QuantumLab/blob/master/1.Radiacao/An%C3%A1lise.ipynb">Radiation:</a></b> Data analysis on the blackbody experiment, the first recognized experiment where quantum effects were found. </li>
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/leonardovaladao/QuantumLab/blob/master/3.%20RaioX/An%C3%A1lise.ipynb">X-Ray:</a></b> Data analysis on an X-Ray experiment. The experimental apparatus "shoots" radiation through a filter, and a detector receives the scattered radiation. Analysing the data collected, I could check the energy levels on an sodium (Na) atom, find the Planck Constant, and discover the filter's material properties.</li>
